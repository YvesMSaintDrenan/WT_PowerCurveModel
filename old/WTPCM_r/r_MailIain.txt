Hi Yves-Marie,

 

I have been testing the power curves function some more, and I wonder if there was an error relating to CpMAX.  It doesn’t matter what you set CpMAX to, you get the same results…

 

I have changed the code on line 93, so that you rescale Cp if WT_param$CpMAX is not a number, rather than if it has length zero.  When you set something to NaN in R, it has length 1.

 

Can you confirm if this is the right thing to do?

 

Kind regards,

Iain
